**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Additional information/Checklist**
_Those can help with narrowing down the issue._
1. Are you using the latest HDRTray version? (You can find the version in the "Properties" of `HDRTray.exe`.)
2. What Windows version are you using (OS build, Experience)? (You can find these in WIndows Settings / System / About).
3. What color- or HDR-related display settings can you think of that were changed from default?
Does toggling any of these settings resolve the issue?
